## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Github Actions
- Github Pages
- vercel
- npm / vite

### To Do

- ~~update selection on each character typed, with setTimeout to wait for pause in typing~~
- ~~escape key on input to clear,~~ maybe a clickable X on the right to do same with mouse.
- detail page formatting
- header fonts at small width (mobile breakpoint)
- index, card hover effect
- index, card focus (on entire card, not just flag)

### Extra Features

- ~~permalink for country details page~~
- ~~permalink for region selection~~
- paginated infinite scrolling on search result
- use IntersectionObserver to hydrate content such as flag and country details when it's scrolled into view
